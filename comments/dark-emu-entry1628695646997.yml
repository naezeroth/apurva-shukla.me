  Great take on the book! I defintiely agree that its a huge shame that the
  controversy has taken attention away from the main purpose of shifting the
  narrative. I also agree that Dark Emu highlights the rich history of
  Indigenous Australia, not only revealing a complicated network of grains but
  also by providing an alternative view from the "deficit lens" that First
  Nation's peoples have been viewed in post-colonial Australian society. 

  Looking more deeply into this, so much of the knowledge in the harvesting and
  processing of these native grains have been lost. Considering that the
  agricultural knowledge accumulated over thousands of years have been
  dispossessed and lost due to colonisation really accentuates how much have
  been taken away from First Nation's people. Thanks for sharing your thoughts!
