  I think accurate reporting can really only happen in a perfect world, or at
  least when the profit motive is taken out of media - excellent article here

  Regarding your question about size - size is directly correlated towards their
  power in the industry and anything that is a monopoly is terrible (no one
  company should be setting the narrative about anything), so yes I definitely
  think size is an issue. Thatâ€™s where the interesting world of decentralized
  media comes in (citizen journalism).
