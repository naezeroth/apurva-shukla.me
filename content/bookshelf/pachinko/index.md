Min Jin Lee's Pachinko is a tale that lasts generations and sweeps us through Japan during the 20th century. It is a tale of hardship, overcoming and love. I thoroughly enjoyed the novel and the endless characters, all of whom I could feel some attachment to. I found the rapid technological changes most fascinating, and Japan's perspective of enduring during the second World War. Ultimately this is a story of a girl who fell in love, and moved across the ocean to a new land that despised her, yet she continued not only to live but to touch so many more lives.
