Homecoming was a touching multi-generational account of the lives of Elfie Shiosaki's family.

Throughout the text, there was a vivid connection to land and country, and Shiosaki's poetic words interspersed between real, historical recordings and letters gave this read an almost magical air.

Shiosaki pieces together her words along with her ancestors, bridging the gap between time and space to deliver truth-telling. It takes us along the cold, inhuman system of taking children away from their families, with first-hand accounts of the grief and trauma this inflicted. We see the self-determination process before our eyes, with Shiosaki collating letters throughout the 1900s of First Nation warriors who fought against the cruelty and discrimination that was inked into law.

It was an evocative read reminding us that what we have now, must not be taken for granted, how far we've come, and how far yet we still have to go.

Suspended in air, rising high into the atmosphere, she will cool down again and condense. Returning to water, she will gather to form clouds and precipitation, drifting over the Darling Ranges towards the Indian Ocean.

> As the footsteps became louder, Ngangk covered Koorlang with her woollen winter coat, tucking her golden red curls in. Koorlang was too small to know this game. All she knew was that she must be so still, so quiet, make herself so small, smaller than the white dots in the night sky.
