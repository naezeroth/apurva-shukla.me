Great message!

My key take aways are that the lived experiences of people are real and valid - one cannot dismiss them and try peel away the layers of what makes you you. Culture is fluid, and if things aren't considered normal and they are unjust then they must be changed to fit. I loved the line "My own definition of feminist is a man or woman who says, 'Yes, there's a problem with gender as it is today, and we must fix it, we must do better'.".
