I tried to like Almond, but I didn’t at all. I think it’s perhaps because it was hard to empathise with a character who has no feelings, and I am a very feeling orientated person. 

Text wise, perhaps this is the case with translations, it was not my cup of tea - language was overly simplistic and left little in the way of themes. Overall, my life was not changed in the slightest after reading this. Apart from reading this with my group for book club, where someone interpreted the whole book quite literally and thought it was all about monsters. That memory made this book a bit more worthwhile. 

Read some time in April 2025
