I listened to The Courage to Be Disliked as I ran earlier this year, and it was a curious experience. I think listening to it was best, as it was designed as a question/answer discussion format between a teacher and a student. It explored something called Individual Psychology (Adlerian Psychology) which was developed by Alfred Adler at a similar time to Freud’s psychoanalysis. 

The key concepts of it included:
- trauma doesn’t exist 
- all human problems stem from interpersonal relationships
- separation of tasks 
- goal of interpersonal relationships is to develop community feeling

Some parts felt oversimplified, which had the danger of not having enough nuance. However, as a text it achieved a satisfactory world view which championed individual autonomy and the ability to change ones circumstances.

Where it differs from conventional understanding of psychology is listed below:
- determinism vs freedom - rejecting trauma as an excuse
- Individual vs social focus - treating social relationships as the source of all problems & solutions 
- Self-esteem vs self-acceptance - accepting yourself regardless of other peoples opinions
- Symptoms treatment vs lifestyle change - Adler advocated for holistic lifestyle changes (worldview & values) instead of individually treating problems. 

Overall, an empowering book.
