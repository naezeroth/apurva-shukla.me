The Housemaid was a thriller in every sense of the word. I haven’t really experienced many books like this, where the pages seemed as if they turned themselves. It felt like a movie, and was digestible enough to feel like you could read it in one sitting. There were a few completely left of centre plot twists that will shock you. 


Overall a read that wasn’t in my usual repertoire, but was definitely enjoyed. 

Read as part of book club, December 2024.
