A great introduction to spirituality and meditation for a Western audience, best suited towards those who have been conditioned to dismiss 'spirituality'. I found it a good supplement to the Waking Up app. 

Sam's take on religion is contentious because it is so bold, but he states his views with clarity and arguments to back it up. It is not callous. However, I am aware that it is a bit reductionist. 

The audiobook version was an easy listen, and is a great way to digest this book.
