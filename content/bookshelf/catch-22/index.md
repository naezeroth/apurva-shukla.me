Scintillating with acerb and wit, Heller entertains us wonderfully, beautifully, and unimaginably. 

I can relate to the fellow readers out there who struggle to bore away into this lengthy and often at times challengingly hard read, but to those I voice: 

"Jump!" 

Jump into the deep end and keep on swimming, because it is - and perhaps always will be - thoroughly, thoroughly worth it.
