Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir is an unputdownable read, chronicling an audacious mission to save the world. I can’t reveal too much, because the book has many curveballs. Just know if you read this, you won’t be able to stop.

I couldn’t believe Weir did such a riveting job in introducing new life forms, and walking us through the science in a way that made you feel like you accomplished something yourself. I loved Rocky as a character, and the ending was a full circle (as he went and taught, but this time in another world).
