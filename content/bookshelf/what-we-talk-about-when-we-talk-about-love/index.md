A poignant collection of stories. Carver presents in each page a message enriched with symbolism and metaphors which allow him to talk about what we talk about when we talk about love. 

There are stories that detail the slow moving lives of old couples, sons with fathers, youthful innocence as well as hard to swallow vignettes of abuse, murder and suicide. 

I absolutely loved these stories, and will revisit them one day in the future.
