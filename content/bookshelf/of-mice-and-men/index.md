It was quite an interesting novella, it had a profound amount of detail in the lives of itinerant workers in the Great Depression. This book captures the struggles of the past, with Steinbeck going to California himself to research the lives of the working class to produce such a true, and vivid piece of literature that will forever remain a classic.
