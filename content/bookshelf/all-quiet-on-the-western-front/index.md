Spellbound, I was drawn in. 

There's honestly not much else to say than this novel is <i>the</i> greatest anti-war novel of all time; and that its contents spew forth the visceral and raw reality of life from one of the most unconventional of places on the planet. 

I really, really enjoyed this artwork, as it can only be called as such, and would even go insofar to say it is on the short list of books that I believe everyone must read before they die.
