A vivid realisation of the tragedies that have befallen women in the past, compiled into a novel which aims to warn just how quickly we can lapse into dystopia. I thoroughly enjoyed this, as Atwood wonderfully captures the atmosphere of Gilead and Offred - I felt like I could suffocate in the same repression that so many in that society felt. 

Really loved it, and with it it's warnings and hopes.
