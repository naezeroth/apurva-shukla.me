**Ostensibly simple, yet dazzlingly rich; both in its witty didacticism and beautiful passages.**

*The Alchemist* is a story of a boy; originally a young shepherd, who finally understands the Language of the World and in response; himself. However, this bildungsroman goes deeper than the 'average boy becoming a man' archetype, and instead efforts - quite fruitfully - to describe our own maturation process. It's through the novel Personal Legend, that our aspirations, dreams and hopes are all etched onto the sand; to present their allure and opalescence for all travellers in this world. However, as with many things, this unique Personal Legend fades away, slowly and slowly, until the omens stop appearing. 

Santiago is a reminder to pursue that path, before it closes forever. 

Remember, <i>“When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.”</i>
