I picked up this book in a bookshop I returned to twice in Rio de Janeiro. It struck out to me with it's yellow cover and interesting cover image.

It has a series of self-contained short stories that are all set in a vague dystopian future. They each explore relationships between the main character and other side characters, and have the same notion of uncertainty. It feels like they are stuck in time, mulling over the same crises of identity and purpose, whittling away at the toothpick with no answers. 

I think it was very clever and had some never before thought of scenarios.

Read sometime in October.
