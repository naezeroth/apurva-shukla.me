Dark, so very dark. 
 
This novel captivates you from the first instance, compelling you into the world of 'annihilation' and utter despair. However, it is not bland; no, no, no. Flynn couples the gruesome nature of the novel with riveting, page turning suspense - a rarity these days. 

Recommend if you like Gone Girl and it's set genre.
