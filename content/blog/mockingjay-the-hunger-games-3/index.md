This book was a huge success in many levels, with the superb plot and amazing vibe. I really was drawn into this book and couldn't stop flipping through the pages.. The only few complaints I had was that the transition of adding the 13th district was very subtle with reasoning backing it until later in the story and the ending which looked like it was rushed.. (What was Gale feeling? etc.) But overall this book was awesome and I would recommend this to anyone who likes an intensive story and a dystopian future.
