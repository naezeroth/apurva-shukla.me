As the range of the stories extended from genre to genre it is hard to judge the book justly, or on face value. Each of these short stories deserve an individual rating as there were a few that personally I felt were not merely written, but rather crafted by solid penmanship and storytelling wit. But alas, there were a few that I couldn't continue reading due to their jargon and fast-pace.
