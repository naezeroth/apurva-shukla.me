This book is indescribable.

The harsh worlds and realities that Herbert presents intertwined with a inter-galactic feudalism, a mystic blend of numerous religions, zen teachings, and emphasis on the oneness of environment with world is endlessly rich and colourful. There are many teachings, philosophies and beauties that flow from this novel and I cannot recommend it highly enough!
