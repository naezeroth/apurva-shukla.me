Over a period of three months I saw the world, and I made sure to write. 

I'm so happy to say with this writing, I've self-published a book!

You can buy it on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B0GDQF1KB8), [Apple](https://books.apple.com/au/book/graveyard-of-lost-and-broken-things-meditations-on-travel/id6757216833), and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=THSlEQAAQBAJ&pli=1) as well as [other book platforms](https://books2read.com/u/brlE9k).
