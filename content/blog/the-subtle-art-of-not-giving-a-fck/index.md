Mark has a very good story telling ability, conveying his learnings from Zen, Buddhism, and experience to a very easy to swallow book. It is succinct and offers a modern day approach to living your best life with plenty of relatable experiences - it’s very interesting to see this since in a way it’s like a bare bones kind of Buddhist philosophy.
