As soon as I flipped to the first page, I was enchanted. 

I have no words, because it is just so superbly written with an excellent blend of social commentary and equally dark moments. The piece can be interpreted in many ways having so many deeper ideas contained within the text making it perfect for studying. It is also amazing just to read for fun as the plot and storyline weaves images of Daniel and Julian's life so splendidly. 

5/5 - A must read book :)
