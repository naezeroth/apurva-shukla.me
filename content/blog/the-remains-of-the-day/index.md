Excellently written, Ishiguro delves into the frame of what could've been; painting a picture of a man who led his life based on his own ideals only to realise the futility in that. A deeply existential thread of what the definition of purpose is crafts this story into one that embodies everyone at one stage in their life; desperately clinging onto some noble ideal or goal, only to realise of its transience and unwavering lack of meaning. Beautiful!
