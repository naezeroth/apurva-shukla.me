title: "Why I selfhost?"

What if I told you there was a way out from having your online movements tracked; precious personal data harvested; and locked in to feeding the coffers of the same few companies that seem to get more powerful year after year - ALL while saving some money?

Selfhosting is simply running the software you use yourself instead of relying on other people's services.

There is no shortage of evidence showing how the modern internet is being increasingly controlled by a handful of companies, which means that only a handful of companies dictate how we spend our time and money. Self-hosting is an effort to break that cycle by running what you need on a computer at home (or on a virtual private server (VPS) if that is how you prefer it).

Whatâ€™s worse is when these companies have the power to ruin your life - just see how it happened to [Terraria's lead developer](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/terraria-developer-cancels-google-stadia-port-after-youtube-account-ban/).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I absolutely have not done anything to violate your terms of service, so I can take this no other way than you deciding to burn this bridge. Consider it burned. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Terraria?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Terraria</a> for <a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleStadia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GoogleStadia</a> is canceled.

The kicker? The best hardware is hardware you already have - so dust off that 10 year old desktop PC and you can very well be on your way. If you don't have any hardware - don't fret! You can get started with a Raspberry Pi 4 for under [$100](https://core-electronics.com.au/raspberry-pi-4-model-b-4gb.html).

It's super rewarding to get started and you'll eventually save money, own your data, and learn a lot!

There are of course varying degrees of self-hosting and I can bet that once you begin you'll find yourself going down many rabbit holes on your new found potential.Â 

I learnt that by running the software I use I'm saving over **$1300 AUD** a year!

Take a look at this table to see what I would be paying and the free equivalent that you can self host.Â

A few others things I'm running include my own Bitcoin node to maintain decentralisation, and a Pi-Hole to block ads for all devices connected to my Wi-Fi.Â 

Here's what my setup looks like - it's running Proxmox with multiple Virtual Machines[^1] (VM's) to host all of these applications.Â

IÂ have also built a PC for my partner, which acts as an offsite backup for my server too!Â

*Confluence was $10 when they were still doing their server licenses - you can use [Anytype](https://anytype.io/) or [Wiki.js](https://js.wiki/) instead.

[^1]: Virtual machines can be thought of dividing one computer up into multiple mini computers each with their own resources.
