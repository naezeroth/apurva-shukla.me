**Where are we?** 

It's 2020. The year so far has been nothing short of a global collapse of order, yet frighteningly the realities we're facing begin and end with ourselves. 

Looking back over the past decade, it's easy to see that there's somehow there was a shift. It was as if the rug was pulled from under us, the cute videos of cats on Youtube replaced by polarised political commentary, world leaders people our we could look up to as role-models, to vitriol spreading bigots who we'd never associate with admiration, and family and friends around us increasingly alone, depressed, and misplaced with our own individual realities.

**How the hell did we get here?**

Flashing headlines appear.

> Trump pulls out of the Paris Agreement; Xi Jinping continues to exterminate Uyghur population; Bolsonaro fans the devastating Amazon fires 

It's all to common to see these phrases, however there is a deep flaw in the way we think about geopoltical events as actions made by individual people. A great insight can be found in Leo Tolstoy's *War and Peace* - where he explores our reductive mindset towards events in history as logical step-by-step manoeuvers by 'great [people]'. In our case, it's far too easy to place the blame of the state of what is to people in power. The truth is, it is us who are swept up in the current of the times and are creating the waves that are crashing down; our world leaders and their actions are just a symptom of the disease growing within us. 

There is no silver bullet for how we got here. The world is unfathomably complex, each seven billion of us housing our dreams and moving forward with our own purpose. To distil the current state of events in a paragraph is unreasonable. However, I can offer a piece of the puzzle. This piece, is by no means small though - it can arguably be responsible for the looming threat to democracy, rise in unhappiness, and collapse of our shared[^1] inter-subjective[^2] reality. 

This is social media.

We have to begin at the advent of the new millenia - the 2000's, just after the dot-com crash that sent a wave of doubt over internet companies. Many companies during this time became bankrupt, but the ones that survived formed the backbone of the internet with increased market share and power. Most notable of these was Google. There came a crucial decision for this company which set a precedent for innumerable companies to follow. How should they make money? The answer could've come in 2 major ways; a paid subscription/per-use model or advertisements. We all know which one Google chose to [follow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Ads).

The reason why this is a pivotal moment is because it changed the collective mindset of internet surfers, services were meant to be 'free'. 




To end I'd like to propose this quote.

> “A man on a thousand mile walk has to forget his goal and say to himself every morning, 'Today I'm going to cover twenty-five miles and then rest up and sleep.”
> ― Leo Tolstoy, War and Peace

If a single individual changes his or her beliefs, or even dies, it is of little importance. However, if most individuals in the network die or change their beliefs, the inter-subjective phenomenon will mutate or disappear." -- Yuval Harari in *Sapiens*
