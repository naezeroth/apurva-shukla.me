**Where are we?** 

It's 2020. The year so far has been nothing short of a global collapse of order, yet frighteningly the realities we're facing begin and end with ourselves. 

Looking back over the past decade, it's easy to see that there's somehow there was a shift. It was as if the rug was pulled from under us, the cute videos of cats on Youtube replaced by polarised political commentary, world leaders people our we could look up to as role-models, to vitriol spreading bigots who we'd never associate with admiration, and family and friends around us increasingly alone, depressed, and misplaced with our own individual realities.

**How the hell did we get here?**

Flashing headlines appear.

> Trump pulls out of the Paris Agreement; Xi Jinping continues to exterminate Uyghur population; Bolsonaro fans the devastating Amazon fires 

It's all to common to see these phrases, however there is a deep flaw in the way we think about geopoltical events as actions made by individual people. A great insight can be found in Leo Tolstoy's *War and Peace* - where he explores our reductive mindset towards events in history as logical step-by-step manoeuvers by 'great [people]'. In our case, it's far too easy to place the blame of the state of what is to people in power. The truth is, it is us who are swept up in the current of the times and are creating the waves that are crashing down; our world leaders and their actions are just a symptom of the disease growing within us. 

There is no silver bullet for how we got here. The world is unfathomably complex, each seven billion of us housing our dreams and moving forward with our own purpose. To distil the current state of events in a paragraph is unreasonable. However, I can offer a piece of the puzzle. This piece, is by no means small though - it can arguably be responsible for the looming threat to democracy, rise in unhappiness, and collapse of our shared[^1] inter-subjective[^2] reality. 

This is social media.

We have to begin at the advent of the new millenia - the 2000's, just after the dot-com crash that sent a wave of doubt over internet companies. Many companies during this time became bankrupt, but the ones that survived formed the backbone of the internet with increased market share and power. Most notable of these was Google. There came a crucial decision for this company which set a precedent for innumerable companies to follow. How should they make money? The answer could've come in 2 major ways; a paid subscription/per-use model or advertisements. We all know which one Google chose to [follow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Ads).

The reason why this is a pivotal moment is because it changed the collective mindset of internet surfers, services were now meant to be 'free'.

> Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitter, Reddit

Each of the products listed above are free to use for end-users (with some offering paid services),  but each cost hundreds of millions of dollars to develop and host every year[^3]. You might have have heard the phrase *if something is free, you are the product*. In reality the way these platforms work is that advertisers are the customers, and you are the product - and these companies are the glue binding both of you together. By providing advertisers with personal data such as your age, location and interests these platforms can create a profile of you that is *immensely* valuable and help advertisers target specific profiles with their ads. 

You might say what's wrong with more relevant ads? Isn't that better than irrelevant ads? 

Well, the truth is these companies will stop at *nothing* to ensure you stay on their platform, so they can continue to sell your attention to advertisers - and hence gain profit. Have you ever caught yourself refreshing your feed? Have you ever wondered why there is no end to scrolling? Have you ever wondered why you keep glancing at your phone to check if you've got a notification? 

The result is that our feeds are curated by algorithms designed to prioritze content that will keep us engaged - and this is more often than not means keeping us fearful or engraged[^4].

You can start to appreciate this destructive cycle. This attention based economy has some very real world consequences beyond just serving you more relevant ads. 

> It has led to a proliferation of fake news and clickbait. It has fuelled surveillance capitalism and normalised pervasive tracking and data-mining. If we want to do something about the proliferation of misinformation and erosion of trust in traditional institutions, it is not enough to regulate or factcheck political adverts. We need to crack down on the use of personal information for all targeted advertising. Otherwise democracy will continue to erode, one highly optimised click at a time.
> -- Arwa Mahdawi[1]

Cambridge Analytica was a poltical consulting firm that was hired by Donald Trump's presidential campaign for the 2016 election. What they did exposed just how powerful Facebook and other social media companies had become. The personal data of nearly 87 million [^5] Facebook users was exploited by Cambridge Analytica. They held 5,000 data points about each of these users and could determinate with the magic of machine learning the people who didn't yet make up their minds regarding the election - they referred to these on-the-fence people as "the persuadables". Using this data, they crafted campaigns set out to create a mixture of fear and anger to sway their vote. And it worked. 

Since then we can trace a growing number of examples of social media's role in defining key events such as Brexit, COVID-19, and most chillingly a call for a U.S. civil war based on the 2020 election results[^6].

This is compounded by state actors using social media as a platform to sow even more disinformation and discord[^7].

**What can we do?**

--> LIST resources to switch from these platforms
--> FOSS (free and open source software)
--> Self hosted solutions
--> 

To end I'd like to propose this quote.

If a single individual changes his or her beliefs, or even dies, it is of little importance. However, if most individuals in the network die or change their beliefs, the inter-subjective phenomenon will mutate or disappear." -- Yuval Harari in *Sapiens*
