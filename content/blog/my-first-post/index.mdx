import { foo } from './foo';

I'm learning React & Gatsby's framework all in one go in an effort to build my own personal website. I'm hoping for it to house my blog, photographs, and projects. **So excited!**

```javascript{numberLines: 2}
export function foo () {
    console.log("Hello world!");
}
```

Hint, check your console!

{foo()}
