This was an amazing journey for me, the entire storyline seemed amazingly well thought out. 
The characters were in depth, and conversations sprang to life. The detail and dedication J.R.R Tolkien spent on this trilogy is awe-striking. 
I absolutely loved this book, and would advise anyone else to follow if they like an epic storyline and a tad bit of inspiration for a story.
