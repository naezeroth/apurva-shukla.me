Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita is a wonderful story weaving together the oppresive, homogenous era under the early years of Stalin rule in Russia with the fantastical retinue of Satan and the epic landscape of Yeshua's (Jesus) cruxifiction ordained by Pontius Pilate. 

This novel houses a beautiful story that will stay with you.
