This book was amazing, I was thinking that the amount of pages the book offers wouldn't be able to tell a good story but this great storyline obviously proves me wrong.  The characters were great but a few were a little underdeveloped, but with the plot and cliffhanger at the end I must say the overall feel of the book was great and indeed look forward to reading Mockingjay.
