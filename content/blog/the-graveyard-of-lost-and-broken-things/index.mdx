For over a year. I planned a walkababout. In a flash, I remember scribbling these lines down on my pocket journal.

> I want the sands of the Sahara (time) to whip me, Amazonian rain to bucket me, till my body, a souvenir of time bears with it, deep of memories, grooves as fine as sandalwood.

This eventually guided me for what this trip would entail. The high level logistics to facilitate this were noted down: how much leave would I need, how much money I'd need to save, and where would I want to go. 

When all three of those parameters were finalised, the next step was literally taking a step into the unknown. 

And I did that. Travel this time around felt different; spiritually and creatively. It was one of the most exhilarating things I've done in my life. And in retrospect, I'm so glad that it happened.

Before heading off, I had a vague notion of writing newsletters, so that I could correspond with my friends and family back home. However, this took a shape of its own when I realised I actually enjoyed writing. Much to my surprise, they were received pretty well too.

When I arrived back home, I took over a month writing the last of my articles; polishing it off in cafés, my living room and meeting rooms at work. Then, when seeing all of my newsletters arranged in front of me, I thought why not making something of it, because it's not often that you get such a serious collection of words together. 

Without further ado, I'm really proud to announce I've published my book: *"The Graveyard of Lost and Broken Things: Meditations on Travel"*. I hope you enjoy it.
